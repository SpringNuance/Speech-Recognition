1. Requirements:

   > cd tools/
   > make     (this will install most of the requirements)

   Additionally, run install_atlas.sh and install_srilm.sh to install ATLAS and SRILM respectively.

2. Installation 

   The CUDA library should be installed before installing Eesen. Then Eesen can be installed as:

   > cd src
   > ./configure --shared --cudatk-dir=/path/to/cuda_library
   > make depend
   > make
   
   EESEN can be built without CUDA (for decoding only, for example)
   by omitting the cudatk-dir argument and specifying --use-cuda=no
