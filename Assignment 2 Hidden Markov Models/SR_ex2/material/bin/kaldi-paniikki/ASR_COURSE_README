This is Kaldi. See http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/about.html

This directory contains the Kaldi binaries compiled for the paniikki classroom environment.
On your machine you need the corresponding scripts. To get the correct version of the scripts,
the easiest is to clone from this repository:

git clone /work/courses/T/S/89/5150/general/bin/kaldi-paniikki 

Make sure you are on the asr-2018 branch, run:

git checkout asr-2018

Now you are setup for running things off these binaries.
Then go to the mini_librispeech recipe:

cd egs/mini_librispeech/s5

Now just copy the data that you are already given, run:

bash copy-data.sh

Now you are set! You should continue by training a DNN acoustic model, see run.sh and local/run_tdnn.sh . You should be able to start directly from running local/run_tdnn.sh
