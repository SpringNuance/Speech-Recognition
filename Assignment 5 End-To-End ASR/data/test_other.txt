there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guest downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shop boy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really liked that account of himself better than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shop boy was the thing i liked best of all
you who were always accusing people of being shoppy at helstone
i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some parts of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the workhouse
his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and missus thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
so they left milton
how tainted asked her father
oh papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and self indulgent were his words
margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgment which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
papa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all
and i do said her father laughing
personally as you call it and all
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but good night child
there were several other signs of something wrong about missus hale
she and dixon held mysterious consultations in her bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was her custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received caresses and fond words back again in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant to give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up her whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well bessy how are you
better and not better if yo know what that means
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing o'nights but i'm weary and tired o milton and longing to get away to the land o beulah and when i think i'm farther and farther off my heart sinks and i'm no better i'm worse
margaret turned round to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress homeward
but for a minute or two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
bessy do you wish to die
bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
nought worse than many others i reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life at milton
i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
as they turned up into a small court opening out of a squalid street bessy said
yo'll not be daunted if father's at home and speaks a bit gruffish at first
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
gasped bessy at last
bessy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
margaret bent over and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
remember who gave it you and made it what it is
now i'll not have my wench preached to
but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be
i believe what i see and no more
that's what i believe young woman
i don't believe all i hear no not by a big deal
but hoo's come at last and hoo's welcome as long as hoo'll keep from preaching on what hoo knows nought about
it's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
but the girl only pleaded the more with margaret
don't think hardly on him he's a good man he is
i sometimes think i shall be moped wi sorrow even in the city of god if father is not there
the feverish colour came into her cheek and the feverish flame into her eye
but you will be there father you shall oh my heart
she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away and bessy roused herself and said
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching at margaret's gown yo'll come again i know yo will but just say it
i will come to morrow said margaret
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home
have you met with a servant dear
no mamma that anne buckley would never have done
suppose i try said mister hale
everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty now let me try
i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all
what would you do papa how would you set about it
why i would apply to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants
very good but we must first catch our house mother
the mother of whom he spoke to us said margaret
missus thornton the only mother he has i believe said mister hale quietly
i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such a careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family
my dear said mister hale alarmed pray don't go off on that idea
i am sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
take notice that is not my kind of haughtiness papa if i have any at all which i don't agree to though you're always accusing me of it
i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy so
they cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her
if called to a case supposed or suspected to be one of poisoning the medical man has two duties to perform to save the patient's life and to place himself in a position to give evidence if called on to do so
he should make inquiries as to symptoms and time at which food or medicine was last taken
he should notice the position and temperature of the body the condition of rigor mortis marks of violence appearance of lips and mouth
in making a post mortem examination the alimentary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation
